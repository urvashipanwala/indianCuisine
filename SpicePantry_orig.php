                <h4 style="text-align: center">SAFFRON <br/>(Kesar)</h4>
                <p>Saffron is the most expensive spice in the world. It’s derived from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus and has a deep auburn colour and sweet flavour. The stigmas can only be picked by hand and it takes 250,000 stigmas to make just half a kilo of saffron, hence its high price. The colour and flavour is intense so in Indian curries just a tiny pinch of saffron would suffice.</p>
